# Graduation Project - Backend Prototype (AO CMS)

This project is the backend component of a full-stack prototype, developed to evaluate multiple CMS solutions in comparison to **AllesOnline** (AO) CMS. It supports a prototype blog site about Napoleon, showcasing essential CMS functionalities like content management, object management, and user management. By integrating different CMS backends, including AO CMS, this project enables feature comparison and exploration of migration possibilities.

The backend provides API endpoints to facilitate data exchange with the frontend, creating a consistent and controlled testing environment for analyzing CMS compatibility, performance, and scalability.
