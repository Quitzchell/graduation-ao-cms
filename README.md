# Graduation project Mitchell Quitz

## Introduction

This project focuses on modernizing the legacy content management system (CMS) used by AllesOnline, a full-service
agency. The current CMS, developed in-house since 2015, has become overly complex and difficult to maintain, limiting
scalability and flexibility. The project explores whether it is worth it to refactor the existing CMS or migrate to a
modern, commercial or open-source CMS. Through research, prototyping, and testing, the aim is to find a sustainable
solution that enhances scalability, maintainability, and future-readiness, while minimizing disruption to existing web
applications and ensuring smooth migration processes.

## Current Repository

This repository is the Backend that includes the AllesOnline CMS.
