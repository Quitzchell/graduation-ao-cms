# AllesOnline CMS boilerplate v3

## Overview

Version 3 of our CMS updates the setup for frontend development.
We now use a minimal setup instead of the bootstrap set that is used in the previous versions of the boilerplate.

The base setup uses the following packages:
- Tailwindcss v3
- Axios
- Laravel Mix

By default, we do not include any additional libraries for frontend development
